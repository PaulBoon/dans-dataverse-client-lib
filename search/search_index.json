DESCRIPTION \u00b6 Dataverse is an open source web application to share, preserve, cite, explore, and analyze research data. See: https://dataverse.org/about .

General \u00b6 When extending the library follow the established patterns, to keep it easy to understand for any new user. JavaDoc \u00b6 Since this is a library, the JavaDocs should be relatively extensive, although there is no need to go overboard with this. At a minimum: The JavaDocs must be generated successfully. As of today this is a standard part of the build; the build will fail if doc generation fails. Every API endpoint method needs JavaDocs that documents the parameters and exceptions and has a deep link to the Dataverse docs for the end-point that is called. This must be a link to target \"_blank\". See existing code for examples. If an example program for the end-point method is available (which should be the case) also add a deep link to (the latest commit of) the example code. Run the documentation site locally to check how it renders. Examples \u00b6 Each API endpoint method should have an example program. The program should be easy to read and usable to try out the end-point. It usually takes a couple of command line parameters so that the user can point it to a specific dataset and try several things without modifying the code. However, these are code examples, and as such as intended to be modified for ad hoc testing. Do not add too many parameters or complex logic to them. Lombok \u00b6 Use the Lombok annotations to: add a logger to classes that may contain logic. Do not add a logger to model classes; automatically generate getters, setters, toString, equals/hashCode and constructors where appropriate.","title":"Development"},{"location":"dev/#development","text":"This page contains information for developers about how to contribute to this project.","title":"Development"},{"location":"dev/#general","text":"When extending the library follow the established patterns, to keep it easy to understand for any new user.","title":"General"},{"location":"dev/#javadoc","text":"Since this is a library, the JavaDocs should be relatively extensive, although there is no need to go overboard with this.

This object can be reused when calling the same Dataverse instance multiple times. The API end-points are grouped in roughly the same way as they appear in the Dataverse documentation: dataverse collection end-points, dataset end-points, etc. The result is a DataverseHttpResponse object, if successful, otherwise an exception. If Dataverse's response is a JSON document, this is converted to a model object, a simple value object. You can retrieve that from the response using the getData method. Running the examples \u00b6 More examples can be found in the examples sub-module . To run an example: Copy the supplied dataverse.properties.template to dataverse.properties . Edit the properties to match your setup. For example; when running Dataverse on localhost, set the baseUrl=http://localhost:8080 . Run one of the programs providing sensible command line parameters where required.","title":"Getting started"},{"location":"getting-started/#getting-started","text":"","title":"Getting started"},{"location":"getting-started/#basic-usage","text":"For including the library as a dependency in a Maven project see the installation instructions A basic usage example follows: public class Test { public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception { // Create a client object DataverseClientConfig config = new DataverseClientConfig( new URI(\"http://localhost:8080/\"), \"your-api-token-here\"); DataverseClient client = new DataverseClient(config); // Call an API end-point DataverseResponse<Dataverse> response = client.dataverse(\"root\").view(); // Retrieve response data as model object Dataverse dv = response.getData(); // Query object System.out.println(dv.getDescription()); } } First you need to create a client object.
